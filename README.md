# vector_calculator
With this project we want to try to make a calculator for vector operations.
The plan is to make a calculator that can do operations with two vectors.

# possible operations
For now we have limited operations with vectors such as: the sum of two vectors and calculating the length of two vectors.

# future features
In the future we want to add functionallity so we can calculate the angle between two vectors and the dot product of two vectors.
Also calculating a vector given two points or calculating two vectors given three points is a feature that will be added in the future.

# flaws
Untill this day, this program only works with possitive numbers. There are also some issues regarding the security and reliabillity of the program.
